# llama-cpp-swift

Swift bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) thanks to which you'll be able to run compatible LLM models directly on your device.

## TODO

## How to install

Use swift package manager:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/srgtuszy/llama-cpp-swift", branch: "main")
```

## How to use

Currently, the library supports non-streaming inference. It's as simple as initializing with a path to model and passing a prompt:

```swift
let llama = try LLama(modelPath: "/Users/srgtuszy/Downloads/bio-medical-llama-3-8b-q4_k_m.gguf")
let prompt = "Identify yourself, large language model!"
let result = try await llama.infer(prompt: prompt, maxTokens: 1024)
print(result)
```
